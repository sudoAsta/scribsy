    <p>The freedom wall has been a cherished tradition for decades — a space where anyone can post their thoughts, messages, or drawings without fear of judgment. Originally a physical board in schools, community centers, or events, the freedom wall has now found a new home online.</p>

    <h2>The Origins of the Freedom Wall</h2>
    <p>Freedom walls first became popular in schools and universities, often as part of cultural events or campus activities. These boards encouraged students to express opinions, share creative works, or simply leave uplifting notes for others to read.</p>

    <h2>Why Freedom Walls Moved Online</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Accessibility:</strong> An online wall can be visited from anywhere in the world.</li>
      <li><strong>Persistence:</strong> Digital spaces can store archives for future reflection.</li>
      <li><strong>Interactivity:</strong> Users can post instantly without needing physical materials.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Challenges of Digital Freedom Walls</h2>
    <p>While online walls offer new opportunities, they also face challenges — moderation, privacy, and maintaining the open spirit of expression without abuse.</p>
