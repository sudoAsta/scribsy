# Proxy share pages from main site to API (bots see OG, humans redirect)
# Example: https://scribsy.io/share/abc123 → https://api.scribsy.io/share/abc123
/share/:id   https://api.scribsy.io/share/:id   200

# Back-compat: if any old links point to /p/:id, redirect them to /share/:id
/p/:id       /share/:id                        301
