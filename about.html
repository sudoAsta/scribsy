      <h2>About Scribsy</h2>
      <p>
        Scribsy is an anonymous, digital “freedom wall” where anyone can share
        short text rants or quick doodles—no account needed, no judgement allowed.
        Every post carries an optional mood tag (“Happy”, “Dreamy”, “Meh”) and
        the name you choose (or “Anonymous”). Each day the wall resets, but
        archives are forever saved in Past Walls for you to revisit.
      </p>
      <p>
        Our mission is to give you a safe, fun space to
        <em>express yourself freely</em>, uncluttered by logins, teams, or trolls.
      </p>

      <h2>How It Works</h2>
      <ol>
        <li>Click “What’s on your mind?” to open the post modal.</li>
        <li>Choose to <strong>Write</strong> (up to 100 characters) or
            <strong>Draw</strong> (quick doodles).</li>
        <li>Optionally add your name &amp; a mood tag.</li>
        <li>Your post appears instantly in the masonry wall.</li>
        <li>Every 24 hours the wall wipes clean—and a snapshot goes to
            <a href="/past.html">Past Walls</a>.</li>
      </ol>
